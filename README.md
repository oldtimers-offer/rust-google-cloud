Uploading an image to Google Cloud Storage via Rust involves setting up a Google Cloud Storage bucket, configuring authentication with a service account, and using an HTTP client in Rust (such as Reqwest) to send the image file to the storage bucket via the Google Cloud Storage API. The Rust application authenticates using the service account credentials and uploads the image to the specified bucket, handling the response and potential errors accordingly.
